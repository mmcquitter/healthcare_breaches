# U.S. Healthcare Breaches Monitor

## Summary

We all want to maintain a level of privacy with our personal information.  Some of our most sensitive data is the personal information we share with our doctors and medical facilities.  From your primary care physician to where you pick up your medicine, this information is very personal.  The US government even enforces specific restrictions and guidelines with HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  As a security professional, I'm interested in how everyday people are affected by exploits and wanted to find a way to illustrated the number of breaches we see in the healthcare industry. Inspired by Stern Security, , we're able to create a data visualization that showed the number of breaches and individuals affected at a high level data published by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services[^1].
