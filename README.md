# U.S. Healthcare Breaches Monitor

## Objective

I wanted to do a project that illustrated to large amount of breaches we see.  After seeing Stern Security promote data published by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, I was inspired to create a data visualization that showed the number of breaches and individuals affected at a high level.
